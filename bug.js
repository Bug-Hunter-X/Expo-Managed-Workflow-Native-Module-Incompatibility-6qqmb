This error occurs when using the Expo managed workflow and attempting to use a library that requires native modules that aren't compatible with Expo Go.  For example, using a library that relies on platform-specific code without properly handling the Expo environment.

```javascript
// Example buggy code
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';

const { SomeNativeModule } = NativeModules;

if (SomeNativeModule) {
  SomeNativeModule.someNativeMethod();
}
```
