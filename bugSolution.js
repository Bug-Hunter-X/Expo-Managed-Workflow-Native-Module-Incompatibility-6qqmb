To resolve this, avoid direct use of native modules. Instead, consider these strategies:

1. **Use Expo modules:** If the functionality you need is available through an Expo module, use that instead.  Expo modules are designed for compatibility with the managed workflow.

2. **Use libraries compatible with Expo:** Look for libraries explicitly stated as compatible with Expo.  Many libraries are designed to work correctly within the Expo environment.

3. **Eject to Bare Workflow (Last Resort):** If you absolutely must use a library with incompatible native modules, consider ejecting your Expo project to a bare React Native workflow. This will give you full control, but increases the complexity of the project and reduces some of the benefits of using Expo.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import * as WebBrowser from 'expo-web-browser'; // Example of Expo Module

const handlePress = async () => {
  let result = await WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync('https://expo.dev');
  console.log(result);
};
```
